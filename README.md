# Collision_detection
Test code for collision detection in Julia/GLMakie


Bugs:
- Collision near boundary may bind two balls together.
- If balls spawn very close, they stick together
- Two binded balls leave the boundary without collision


Need to do:
- Optimise and clean code
- Add graph for kinetic energy
- Change visuals
- Somehow reduce the loading time of code
